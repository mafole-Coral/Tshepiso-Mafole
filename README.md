Hi, I'm Tshepiso. I'm a scientist.                                                                                                                                              

I value living outside the box and embrace resilience. These ideals guide my approach to problem-solving and life in general.

## About Me
I am an ecologist driven by a passion for understanding the natural environmentâ€”its functions and its role in sustaining ecosystem components and human well-being, particularly under the pressures of environmental change and disturbances. My work has centered on Mediterranean-type ecosystems, utilising methods such as species distribution modeling (*MaxEnt, R, QGIS, GBIF*), demographic matrix models (*Leslie, Lefkovich, R, COMPADRE-Plant Matrix Database*), and field-based vegetation surveys to develop frameworks for ecosystem management in the context of climate change.

I am broadening my expertise to explore the integration of nature, technology, and business, aiming to drive innovative solutions for a nature-positive future.

## Interests
- C4 grass expansion in Mediterranean-type ecosystems
- Biodiversity Big Data
- Environmental Remediation Strategies
